IEOR 4500 HW 1 due September 18

Use the data in "russell_prices.txt" available on Courseworks, for 947 assets
over 504 days

1. Compute sample mean returns and sample covariance matrix.
2. Implement the algorithm for mean-variance portfolio optimization problem described in "qp.pdf".  Here each asset can have weight between 0 and 1.  You can use Python, Java, C or C++.
3. For lambda = 0, how many assets do you have in your optimal basket, and what risk (total variance) do you have?
4. Plot an approximate risk (variance) v. return curve by running the optimization over different choices of lambda.  What is the smallest variance you see
in any of these optimizations?
5. Let s2_0 be the variance you reported in #3, and let s2_min be the variance
you reported in #4.  Define s2_mid = 0.5(s2_0 + s2_min).  Estimate the value of
lambda needed so that your optimal portfolio has variance s2_mid.
